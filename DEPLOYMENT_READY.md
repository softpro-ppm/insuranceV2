# 🚀 Fixed Insurance Management System v2.0

## ✅ Issues Fixed in This Commit:

1. **File Structure:** Moved from `public/` directory structure to root structure for Hostinger subdomain compatibility
2. **Config Fix:** Removed `storage_path()` function and replaced with `sys_get_temp_dir()`
3. **Path Updates:** Fixed all include paths to work from root directory
4. **Asset Paths:** Ensured all asset references work correctly

## 📁 New File Structure (Ready for Hostinger):

```
/
├── index.php           ← Main entry point (moved from public/)
├── .htaccess          ← Apache rules (moved from public/)
├── app/               ← Core application
├── config/            ← Configuration (FIXED!)
├── database/          ← Database schema
├── resources/         ← Views and templates
├── assets/            ← CSS, JS, Images
├── .env               ← Environment config
└── README.md          ← Documentation
```
