## ðŸš€ Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Replace These 2 Files in Hostinger
Go to Hostinger File Manager and replace these files:

1. **Replace:** `/public_html/v2/config/app.php`
   - **With:** `deployment_package/config/app.php`

2. **Replace:** `/public_html/v2/public/index.php`
   - **With:** `deployment_package/public/index.php`

### Step 2: Test Immediately
Visit: `https://v2.insurance.softpromis.com/`

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Fixed
- Removed Laravel-style `storage_path()` function
- Replaced with `sys_get_temp_dir()` for sessions
- Fixed file paths and includes

## ðŸ“± Expected Result
After uploading the fixed files, you should see:
- âœ… Login page loads properly
- âœ… No more "storage_path" errors
- âœ… System works normally

## ðŸ†˜ If Still Not Working
1. Check your domain is pointing to `/public_html/v2/public/`
2. Ensure database is imported correctly
3. Try accessing: `https://v2.insurance.softpromis.com/public/`
